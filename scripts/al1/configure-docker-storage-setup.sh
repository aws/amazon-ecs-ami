# ECS-optimized AMIs are provisioned with two disks:
# 1) Root volume at /dev/sda (GP2, 8GB, delete on terminate)
# 2) Extra EBS volume at /dev/xvdcz just for Docker (GP2, 22GB, delete on terminate)
#
# We use docker-storage-setup to configure this additional device properly.
# By default docker-storage-setup will configure 40% of the device, and will
# then grow the available space over time up to the maximum in the pool
# (volume group).  We can tweak the initial space higher if necessary, but
# cannot set DATA_SIZE=100%FREE, as some space must be reserved for the
# metadata and root of the pool.
#
# VG=docker because that's what the volume group is for.
